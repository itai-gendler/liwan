# View Project settings — access rejected

## Trigger

A valid dashboard session resolves to the ordinary User role when this administration request is attempted.

## Outcome

The request returns Forbidden (403) before protected settings are disclosed or the requested administrative operation is performed.

## Edge cases

- A missing or invalid dashboard session returns Unauthorized (401) before this operation; malformed browser credential pairs are cleared.
