# Send event batch — mixed filtered

## Trigger

A valid in-scope batch includes admitted Pageviews and custom events plus collection-filtered entries.

## Outcome

Accepted/filtered counts reflect processing; only admitted entries are queued. A payload/scope rejection is distinguished from deliberate filtering.

## Edge cases

- Acknowledgement is not a persistence receipt; async append errors are separately represented by accepted-write-lost.

- If every valid in-scope entry is filtered, the response is 202 with accepted zero and the filtered count; no event reservation is needed.
